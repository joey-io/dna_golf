		<h1>Perfect Practice</h1>
		<p>Stance, grip, backswing, downswing, impact, follow through, delivery. One wrong move and this beautiful game becomes a guessing game. But It doesn't have to be. To many, golf is an art. To DNA, it's also a science. This revolutionary way of thinking is exactly what lead to the development of the <strong><em>Ring Swing Trainer</em></strong>.</p> 

		<p>Every aspect of a golfers game is perfected during the very first practice with the <strong><em>Ring Swing Trainer</em></strong>. They can experience the mechanics, motion, and flow of an ideal swing, over and over again. From that point on, it's muscle memory and a part of their swing's DNA.</p> 

		<p><strong>The <em>Ring Swing Trainer</em> caters to every level of golfer.</strong></p> 

		<p>Beginning golfers can experience the feel of an ideal swing immediately as an integral part of their early golf instruction and professional lessoning instead of waiting years to hone a proper swing.</p> 

		<p>Intermediate golfers can maintain their ideal swing as well as enhance key aspects of their swing such as swing speed, address, tempo and follow-through.</p> 

		<p>Low handicap golfers can enhance aspects of their swing as well as ensure their swing is constantly in tune.</p>
